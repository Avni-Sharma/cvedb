title: CVE in express-restify-mongoose
description: >
    express-restify-mongoose is a module to easily create a flexible REST interface for mongoose models. express-restify-mongoose 2.4.2 and earlier and 3.0.X through 3.0.1 allows a malicious user to send a request for `GET /User?distinct=password` and get all the passwords for all the users in the database, despite the field being set to private. This can be used for other private data if the malicious user knew what was set as private for specific routes.
